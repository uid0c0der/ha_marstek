## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Which devices are supported?**

   Supports Venus A, Venus D, Venus E 3.0 with new firmware versions, as well as other Marstek devices that support OPEN API communication.

2. **Why can't I find my device?**

   - OPEN API is not enabled on the device
   - Ensure Marstek devices and Home Assistant are on the same network segment, and port 30000 is open
   - The integration searches for devices via UDP broadcast. Network fluctuations may affect communication between devices and HA. It is recommended to retry

3. **What is OPEN API?**

   OPEN API is a communication interface provided by Marstek device firmware for querying device status and controlling some commands in a local network environment.
